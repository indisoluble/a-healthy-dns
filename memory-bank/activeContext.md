# Active Context

## Current Sprint / Focus
- **Memory Bank initialization** — first-time setup of the AGENTS 2.1 Memory Bank from code analysis (2026-02-25).
- No active feature work in progress.

## Recent Changes (Last Tagged Release)
- **v0.1.26** (`13de8fd`): Added multi-domain support via alias zones (`ZoneOrigins` class, `--alias-zones` CLI arg).
- **Agent setup** (`8ffa5fd`, branch `agent-zero`): Added `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Working Branch
- `agent-zero` — 1 commit ahead of `master` (AGENTS.md addition).

## Current State
- All 236 tests passing.
- No uncommitted code changes.
- No open issues or PRs referenced in the repo.
- No CI/CD pipeline defined in the repository.

## Next Priorities
- To be defined by the user after Memory Bank setup.

## Open Questions
- No CI configuration — tests run locally only.
- No linter/formatter configuration — coding standards are convention-based.
- No `pyproject.toml` — still using `setup.py` for packaging.
